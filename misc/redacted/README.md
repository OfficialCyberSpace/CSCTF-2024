First, you can see that the horse head pfp person who sent a message with an image is the same one that is logged in.

Second, there is a link in the message that is the link to the image, which contains the channel id, googling this id results in a link which takes you to the "MINECRAFT" official community discord.

Third, the search result can be narrowed by searching using the selectors to filter and keep only messages after two days before this picture was taken and before the date of the picture, because the picture was taken "Yesterday" as seen in the image. searching for some phrase seen in the picture like "before i am curious" results in one message that is sent by the user who took the screenshot.

Fourth, click on their username to see their "About Me" section.
